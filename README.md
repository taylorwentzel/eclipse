# Eclipse
This is a video game I created for one of my CS classes. It game will run on Mac or Linux.

## Requirements
This game requires that [Mednafen](https://mednafen.github.io/) be installed.
   ```sh
   sudo apt-get install mednafen
   ```
[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is also required. Installation instructions can be found [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

## Run
Simply run the following inside the repository:
  ```sh
  ./run.sh
  ```
Upon starting the game, press `[Alt] + [Shift] + [1]` to set your key bindings. Key bindings only need to be set once.
